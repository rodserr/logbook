Actuarial science grad turned data enthusiast! I leverage my analytical background across data analysis, science, and engineering. Lately, spatial data and mapping have piqued my interest.

I build visualizations and interactive tools, empowering decision-making in finance, recruiting, and urban tech.  Experience and a curious mind fuel my work, not just degrees. in this blog I share my projects, thoughts, and learnings.
